## Our Core Values

- **Service**: We value that what we do is being of service to consumers, customers, and internal partners
- **Mutual Respect**: We respect and encourage diverse backgrounds, lifestyles, and personalities
- **Communication**: We strive to communicate our activities inside and outside of the team
- **Openness**: We and our work-products are open and available for anyone to see and improve
- **Leadership**: Everyone leads and everyone follows, setting an example for federal government
- **Learning and Innovation**: We seek to apply creative thinking to improve what we do all the time. We constantly seek ways to improve ourselves and our teams
- **Willingness**: We are willing to help each other with anything that is good for the team
- **Excellence**: We believe that excellence is defined by a commitment to and practice of constant learning and improvement

## Our Front-end web development values

1. End goals of the user should be what drive the front-end design.
2. Pages, apps, and sites should be inclusive of all users.
3. We want to continue to use cutting-edge technologies and methods to build modern applications, but without compromising usability for all consumers.
4. Testing in supported browsers should be as painless as we can make it.
5. Websites should download quickly and not cost users on metered data connections much money.
6. Development workflows and standards are understood by all of us and easy to maintain.
